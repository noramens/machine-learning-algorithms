# Unsupervised Machine Learning

Unsupervised Machine Learning uses labelled input data and allows the algorithm to act on that information without guidance.

## MAJOR TYPES OF UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING

- Clustering:
  This is used for analysing and grouping data which does not include pre-labelled class or even a class attribute at all.

- Association:
  Discovers the probability of the co-occurance of items in a collection

### Problem statement

A hotel chain wants to establish its new delivery centers across a city in the most optimised way.

### Possible challenges

- Analyse the areas from where food is being ordered frequently
- Figure out the optimum number of hotels required to cover the city area
- Figure out the optimal hotel locations to minimise the distance between the hotel and delivery points.
