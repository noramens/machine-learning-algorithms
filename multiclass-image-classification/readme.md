# Multiclass Image Classification using CNN

Image classification is the process of taking an image or picture and getting a computer to automatically classify or providing the probability of the class image.

A class is essentially a label for instance, cat, car, building and so on.

### Application of Image Classification

- Image classification is used in radiology to help medical profession identify anomalies in X-ray
- Image classification helps in self driving cars to classify images around them to help the car identify how to navigate the road.

### Challenges of Image Classification

- Change in viewport
- Change of illumination
- Deformation
- Backgrounnd clutter

## Problem Statement

To predict weather conditions using machine learning; multiclass image classification using CNN

We will work on a weather dataset which is available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijaygiitk/multiclass-weather-dataset)
